To Do.

Syntax Highlighting:
- darken the highlight color for when a closed region is highlighted
- test every corner of Pyret's syntax, make sure we're happy with the chosen colors
  - yellow strings or (ooh) green strings?

CPO Editor:
- darken the interactions window
- darken error messages / check block messages

Chrome Ext.:
- sites to run on: "code.pyret.org", "pyret.cs.brown.edu", and "cpo.herokuapp.com"
- add smol interface:
  - dark pyret banner
  - on/off toggle

Maybe they should just disable the extension to disable the colors...
